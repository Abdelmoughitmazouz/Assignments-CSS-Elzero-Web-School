## Assignments 01

- Create a `Framework` for yourself that contains the following capabilities:
- First, a `Class` named `“center-flex”` when placed on an element, centers the elements inside it lengthwise and widthwise using `Flex`
- Second, a `Class` named `“center-position”` when placed on an element, centers the element lengthwise and widthwise in the parent element
- Third, a `Class` named `“circle-100”` when placed on an element, makes the width and length `100px`, then converts it to a circle
- Fourth, a `Class` named `“circle-200”` when placed on an element, makes the width and length `200px`, then converts it to a circle

## Assignments 02

- Create a `class` called `arrow` and with it `Classes` for all directions `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
- Make sure that each `class` is for a specific direction and the arrow appears in the same direction
- Make sure that the direction `class` only works in the presence of a `class` called `arrow`
- Make sure that the arrow is always in the middle regardless of the length and width of the element
